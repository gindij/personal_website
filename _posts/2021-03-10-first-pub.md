I wanted to share that I've been fortunate enough to publish my first bit of
academic research that I collaborated on with [Nick Moehle](https://www.nicholasmoehle.com/),
Prof. [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/),
and Prof. [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/)! When people ask me
what I wish I could have done differently in college, I often lament that I didn't
take the opportunity to get involved with more research. I'm really grateful
that I've had the opportunity to participate in writing this paper, and hope to
collaborate on a few more down the road!

You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05455), and
an open-sourced implementation of some of the algorithms we talk about
[here](https://github.com/blackrock/lcso). Happy to discuss if you're interested!
