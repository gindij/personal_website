Papers I've had the privilege of contributing to:

| Title/Link | Author(s) | Year     | Description |
|------------|---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| [Portfolio contstruction as linearly constrained separable optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05455) | Moehle et al | 2022 | ADMM-based fast portfolio optimization. |
| [Finding AI-Generated Faces in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08577.pdf) | Aniano et al | 2023 | AI-generated face detection at scale. |


As time permits, I also like to (try) to keep read papers about applied math and
machine learning. Below you'll find an archive of papers I've read that I think
are worthwhile:

| Title/Link | Author(s) | Year    | Description |
|------------|-----------|---------| ----------- |
| [Accelerating Large Language Model Decoding with Speculative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01318.pdf) | Chen et al, DeepMind | 2023 | This paper introduces a method to speed up the decoding process in large language models. It explores speculative sampling techniques to enhance performance efficiency. |
| [Modularity and community structure in networks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0601602103) | M.E.J. Newman | 2006 | Elegant spectral method for community detection. |
| [Scalable Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3447548.3467404) | Monath et al, Google | 2021 | A scalable, level-based approach to hierarchical agglomerative clustering. |
| [Pearl: A Production-Ready Reinforcement Learning Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03814.pdf) | Zhu et al, Meta | 2023 | This paper introduces Pearl, a modular reinforcement learning agent designed for production environments. |
| [Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4) | Fawzi et al, DeepMind | 2022 | This paper introduces AlphaTensor, an RL-based algorithm to find faster ways to multiply matrices. |
