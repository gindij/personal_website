My name is Jack Gindi. I'm an ML engineer who loves working at the intersection
of programming and mathematics.

I'm currently a senior ML engineer at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) working
on preventing abusers and other bad actors from coming onto the platform. You can
find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackegindi/).

Prior to LinkedIn, I worked at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com) as a quant
strategist (Strat) in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Before that I worked as a
quant developer/research engineer in the [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai#open-source).
During my time there, I worked on projects in machine learning and optimization, with
applications to optimal wealth management in retirement (decumulation), tax-aware
portfolio construction, and securities lending.

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at UPenn in May 2017 after
completing a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from
UPenn). I'm currently pursuing a part-time MS in Scientific Computing at NYU.

In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing, reading, writing, and spending
time with my wife and son.
