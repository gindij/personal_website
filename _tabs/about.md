My name is Jack Gindi. I'm currently a machine learning engineer at
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) on an anti-abuse team. You can
find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackegindi/).

Prior to LinkedIn, I worked at [Goldman
Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com) as a quant
strategist (Strat) in Goldman Sachs Asset Management
([GSAM](https://www.gsam.com/)). Before that I worked as a
quant developer/research engineer in the
[BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai#open-source).
During my time there, I worked on projects in machine learning and
optimization, with applications to optimal wealth
management in retirement (decumulation), tax-aware
portfolio construction, and securities lending.

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at
UPenn in May 2017 after completing a Bachelor's in
Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from
UPenn). I'm currently pursuing a part-time MS in Scientific
Computing at NYU.

In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing,
reading, writing, and spending time with my wife and son.
