During my time at UPenn, I completed a double major in
Mathematics and Computer Science (2016) and a Master's degree in
Computer Science (2017). I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in
Scientific Computing at the Courant Institute (NYU, 2021 -- present).

Courses of interest that I've taken include:
* Numerical Methods 1 (NYU)
* Machine Learning (NYU)
* Advanced Randomized Algorithms (UPenn)
* Advanced Programming in Haskell (UPenn)
* Artificial Intelligence (UPenn)
* Distributed Systems (UPenn)
* A bunch of math courses

In addition to my formal academic studies, I've continued my education on my own
time:
* [Probability theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo) (Harvard, YouTube), statistical inference (Columbia, in-person)
* Statistical Inference (Columbia, in-person)
* [Convex optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) (Stanford, in-person)
* [Reinforcement learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) (University of Alberta, Coursera)
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Since leaving school, I've also revisited linear algebra a few times from a few different angles,
and would recommend the following resources to anyone interested in the subject:
* [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/file_spring2018/linear_algebra_done_right.pdf)
* [Intro to Applied Linear Algebra](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
* [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617)
