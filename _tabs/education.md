During my time at UPenn, I completed a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science (2016)
and a Master's degree in Computer Science (2017). I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in
Scientific Computing at the Courant Institute (NYU, 2021 -- present).

Courses I've taken relevant to my job include:
* Numerical Methods 1, Monte Carlo Methods, High-Performance Computing (NYU)
* Machine Learning (math), Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision (NYU)
* Statistical Inference (Columbia)
* Convex Optimization (Stanford)
* [Reinforcement learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) (University of Alberta, Coursera)

Other fun courses I've taken:
* Advanced Randomized Algorithms (UPenn)
* Advanced Programming in Haskell (UPenn)
* Software Foundations (theorem proving software, UPenn)

Since leaving school, I've also revisited linear algebra a few times from a few different angles,
and would recommend the following resources to anyone interested in the subject:
* [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/file_spring2018/linear_algebra_done_right.pdf)
* [Intro to Applied Linear Algebra](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
* [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617)
