I"ë<p>My name is Jack Gindi. I currently work in New York as a quant developer in the <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual">BlackRock</a> AI Labs.
Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve worked on projects in machine learning and, more recently, optimization. Before working at BlackRock, I was a data platform engineer at a startup called <a href="https://opengov.com">OpenGov</a>. You can find my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackegindi/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I completed my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at UPenn in May 2017 after completing a bachelorâ€™s in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from UPenn).</p>

<p>In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing, reading, and writing.</p>
