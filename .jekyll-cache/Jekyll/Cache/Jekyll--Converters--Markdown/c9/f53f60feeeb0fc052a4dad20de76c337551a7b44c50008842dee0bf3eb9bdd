I"<p>After writing a post about one interesting way to arrive at a closed-form for the (n)th term of the Fibonacci sequence, a friend pointed out a few alternative ways to get there, one of which felt particularly natural. It requires some linear algebra, so I guess that in some sense, it could be considered “unnatural,” but I especially like it because the argument’s flow requires fewer arbitrary-seeming leaps. With that said, this post will be brief (as I’m a little busy at the moment), so if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or is incorrect, please do reach out and let me know.</p>

<p>The Fibonacci sequence can be viewed through the lens of matrices. In particular, if we start with the matrix [A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},] we can see that the Fibonacci sequence can be materialized by repeatedly multiplying (A) by itself.</p>

<p>To see this, first notice that if we are considering the Fibonacci sequence that starts with (F_0 = 0) and (F_1 = 1), then we note that [A = \begin{bmatrix} F_2 &amp; F_1 \ F_1 &amp; F_0 \end{bmatrix}.] Suppose now that [A^{n-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{n-1} = \begin{bmatrix} F_{n-1} &amp; F_{n-2} \ F_{n-2} &amp; F_{n-3} \end{bmatrix}] for (n \geq 3). Then [A^n = A^{n-1}A = \begin{bmatrix} F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} &amp; F_{n-2} + F_{n-3} \ F_{n-2} + F_{n-3} &amp; F_{n-2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} F_n &amp; F_{n-1} \ F_{n-1} &amp; F_{n-2} \end{bmatrix}.] Thus, to get the (n)th element of the Fibonacci sequence, we need only get the upper left entry of (A^n). If we had a fast way to obtain (A^n) instead of actually carrying out iterated matrix multiplication, we could obtain the (n)th element without doing very much work.</p>

<p>To do this, we will look to diagonalize (A). This means that we will try to write [A = VDV^{-1}] where (D) is a diagonal matrix and (V) is a matrix with eigenvectors of (A) as columns (we have to actually find (D) and (V) that work). What’s nice about a diagonal representation is that [A^n = (VDV^{-1})^n = VDV^{-1}VDV^{-1}\dots VDV^{-1} = VD^nV^{-1}.] If (D) is written as a matrix with (\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n) on the diagonal, then (D^n) is simply (D) with the elements on the diagonal each taken to the (n)th power, like so: [D = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix} \implies D^n = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1^n &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; \lambda_2^n \end{bmatrix}.]</p>

<p>Now that we’ve laid out our approach, it’s time to carry it out. (I will spare the algebra required to keep this post brief.)</p>

<p>The eigenvalues of (A) (as you might expect if you read my last post) are (\lambda_1,\lambda_2 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2}), and the corresponding eigenvectors are (v_1, v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2} \ 1 \end{bmatrix}). Thus, we have [D = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2} &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2} \end{bmatrix} ~~~~ V = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2} &amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2} \ 1 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}.]
With these in hand, we see that (A) is indeed diagonalizable, so that (A^n) can be written as (VD^nV^{-1}), and voila! with two matrix multiplications and exponentiating the diagonal entries of (D), we can very quickly and efficiently come up with large Fibonacci numbers quickly.</p>
